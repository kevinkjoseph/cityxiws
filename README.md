# Water Supply Inequalities in a Large Indian City
This repo is associated with the thesis titled "Water Supply Inequalities in a Large Indian City". A thesis submitted in conformity with the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Civil and Mineral Engineering from the University of Toronto in September 2024.

# Abstract 

Approximately 1 billion people rely on Intermittent Water Supply systems that supply water for
less than 24 hours/day. Recent commitments such as United Nations Sustainable Development
Goal 6 have pushed cities to improve their water distribution networks. But many water systems
continue to operate intermittently. To understand the inequality and rate of improvement in water
supply, we explored the spatial and temporal variations across 13,644 water supply schedules in
an anonymized Indian city (>1 million people). The average supply continuity was 1.19 hours/day,
average supply duration was 10 hours/supply and average supply frequency was 3.5 supply/month.
But supply varied widely between areas: supply continuity by 10 times, supply duration by 11.8
times and supply frequency by 1.5 times. Over 15 months of data, we also find average supply
continuity improved modestly by 1.2% per month but improved fastest for the worst supplied areas
(1.5% per month).
